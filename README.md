# CMSC422 - Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to my repository for ```CMSC422 - Introduction to Machine Learning``` at the ```University of Maryland, College Park```. This repository includes a summary and the grade received for the homeworks and projects that I completed throughout this course. Due to university policies, the code for these projects is not publicly available. If you are an employer or have a legitimate request to view the code, please contact me directly.

## Assignments 

### Project 1: **Classification**
**Description:**  
- Implemented several core machine learning classification algorithms completely from scratch in Python.
- Built **baseline classifiers** (e.g., always predict majority class, first-feature rule) to understand evaluation and accuracy computation.
- Designed a **Decision Tree classifier** with configurable maximum depth, implementing recursive training, prediction, and visualization of learned trees.
- Developed a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** and **epsilon-ball classifier**, including support for hyperparameter tuning and dimensionality reduction experiments.
- Implemented a **Perceptron classifier**, training it on multiple datasets (e.g., sentiment analysis, digit classification) and visualizing decision boundaries in low dimensions.
- Conducted **empirical analysis** through training/test accuracy evaluation, learning curves, hyperparameter curves, and dimensionality reduction studies.
- Strengthened understanding of **bias-variance tradeoff**, **overfitting vs. underfitting**, and **generalization performance**.
